Welcome to Game Hub, a collection of interactive and engaging games developed using the latest technologies in .NET and Blazor. This repository currently includes two games: WordGame and ImageGame.

üìù Project Overview
üéÆ WordGame
WordGame is a challenging word-guessing game where players must deduce hidden words within a given time frame. The game features different difficulty levels and provides real-time updates to enhance the player experience.

Gameplay Mechanics
Starting the Game:

Select a level and category to begin.
Depending on the difficulty level, certain characters in the word will be hidden.
Guessing the Word:

Choose letters to guess the hidden word.
Correct guesses allow you to proceed to the next level.
Incorrect guesses or running out of time will prompt a retry or a return to the main menu.
Health and Hints:

Players have a limited number of health points.
Hints can be used to reveal letters, but they may reduce the available health.
Health regenerates over time, allowing players to return after a break.
Winning the Game:

Players advance through levels by correctly guessing the words.
Completing all levels in a category results in a win.
